I'm a full-time researcher at [State Key Laboratory of Block Chain and Data Security, Zhejiang University](https://bcds.zju.edu.cn/), working in the software engineering research group led by [Prof. Xin Xia](https://xin-xia.github.io/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree and bachelor degree from School of Computer Science at Nanjing University (NJU), supervised by [Prof. Xuandong Li](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lixuandong/index.htm) and [Prof. Tian Zhang](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhangtian/index.htm). During my Ph.D. studies, I was a visiting student at the Cyber Security Lab (CSL), Nanyang Technological University (NTU) sponsored by China Scholarship Council (CSC), under the guidance of [Associate Prof. Yi Li](https://liyiweb.com/) and [Associate Prof. Shangqing Liu](https://shangqing-liu.github.io/). 

My research interests include code intelligence, mining software repositories, empirical software engineering, and knowledge-enhanced techniques, etc.
